# The Elixir Ecosystem

The Elixir ecosystem is a collection of libraries, tools, and services that extend the capabilities of Elixir. Here is an overview of some of the most popular and widely-used projects in the Elixir ecosystem.

## The Web

### Phoenix Framework

Phoenix is a popular web development framework for building web applications with Elixir. Server-side rendering and real-time communication, are some of its key features. Has LiveView built-in, allowing developers to build interactive, real-time applications while writing little to no JavaScript.

[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html)

### Phoenix LiveView

LiveView is a library that enables rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML. It allows developers to build interactive, real-time applications while writing little to no JavaScript.

[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/welcome.html)

### SurfaceUI

A server-side rendering component library that allows developers to build rich interactive user-interfaces, writing minimal custom Javascript.

[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/surface/Surface.html)

### LiveState

The goal of LiveState is to make highly interactive web applications easier to build. Currently, in most such applications, clients send requests and receive responses from and to a server API. This essentially results in two applications, with state being managed in both in an ad hoc way.

LiveState uses a different approach. Clients dispatch events, which are sent to the server to be handled, and receive updates from the server any time application state changes. This allows state to have a single source of truth, and greatly reduces client code complexity. It also works equally well for applications where updates to state can occur independently from a user initiated, client side event (think "real time" applications such as chat, etc).

### Plug

A specification and composable modules for web application components, enabling HTTP request handling.

### Absinthe

A GraphQL toolkit for Elixir, an implementation of the GraphQL specification built to suit the language's capabilities and idiomatic style

[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/absinthe/overview.html)

### Hologram

Hologram is a full stack isomorphic web framework that can be used on top of Phoenix.

[Documentation](https://github.com/bartblast/hologram)

## Native Applications

### Scenic

Scenic is an application framework written directly on the Elixir/Erlang/OTP stack. With it, you can build client-side applications that operate identically across all supported operating systems, including MacOS, Ubuntu, Nerves/Linux, and more.

[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/scenic/welcome.html)

### LiveView Native

LiveView Native allows you to build LiveView apps that have a front-end for multiple platforms. Use your LiveView back-end to create a web, mobile, wearable and/or desktop UI.
